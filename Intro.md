# ☕ Java Practice Programs & Code Examples

## Project Description

This repository is a comprehensive collection of practice programs and foundational code examples dedicated to reinforcing essential Java programming skills. It covers core Java concepts, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), data structures, exception handling, and standard library usage.

It is designed to be a perfect resource for beginners and for developers looking to polish their foundational Java knowledge.

## Repository Contents

The code is organized into specific folders to make finding topics easier:

| Folder Name | Focus Area | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `01_Fundamentals` | **Basics** | Syntax, data types, operators, loops, and conditional statements. |
| `02_OOP` | **OOP Concepts** | Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and interfaces. |
| `03_Collections` | **Data Structures** | Examples using common Collection Framework classes (e.g., `ArrayList`, `HashMap`, `HashSet`). |
| `04_Exceptions` | **Error Handling** | Code illustrating `try-catch-finally` blocks and custom exceptions. |
| `05_Advanced` | **Advanced Topics** | Multi-threading, File I/O operations, and basic Stream API examples. |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run these programs locally, you will need:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or newer is recommended.
* **Git:** To clone the repository from GitHub.
* **An IDE or text editor:** (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

### How to Run the Programs

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project folder:**
    ```bash
    cd YOUR-REPO-NAME
    ```
3.  **Run a specific program (Command Line):**
    For example, to run a program in the `01_Fundamentals` folder:
    ```bash
    cd 01_Fundamentals
    javac MyProgram.java
    java MyProgram
    ```
    *(Note: If you are using an IDE like IntelliJ, you can simply open the project and run the files directly.)*
